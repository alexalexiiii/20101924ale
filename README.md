## Howdy, I'm Alexandra ðŸŒ¼
(she/her)
I am currently completing my course in Computer Forensics & Security at SETU Waterford. While my primary passion lies in cybersecurity, Iâ€™m also deeply interested in law and legal principles, particularly in how they intersect with technology. I enjoy studying the defensive side of cybersecurity also!  Currently , Im researching malware and how advanced malware detects that its in a sandbox environment, and ways to prevent that detection!

Additionally, I enjoy creating engaging software designs and exploring UX principles to better understand user behavior and enhance digital experiences. 
Here's my portfolio website! I have my substack linked with my first article published on sandbox evasion :)
